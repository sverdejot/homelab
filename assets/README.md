## Rack cabinet

![Rack cabinet](./img/cabinet.png)

This model is still a WIP. It has been design to fit a `Mercusys MS105GP` or a `TP-Link SG105-MPE`. The former is a cheap alternative that just handles up to 65W total between all PoE+ port and the latter is a powerful one that handlers 120W (up to 30W per PoE+ port), enough to power all 4 Raspberry Pi's
